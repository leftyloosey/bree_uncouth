  p1: 'I am an architectural historian and Assistant Professor of Architecture at the University of Utah. My research investigates the evolution of residential architecture in times of socio-political change in relation to the collapse of the USSR, and to the rising housing insecurity in North American cities. I studied architecture at the National Academy of Fine Arts and Architecture, Kyiv, Ukraine. I continued my studies at the School of Architecture and Urban Planning, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, where I received my PhD in the Buildings-Landscapes-Cultures Program in 2019.',
  p2: 'I am the author of two books: Taking the Soviet Union Apart Room by Room (NIUP/Cornell UP, 2023) and Mass Housing in Ukraine (co-authored with Philipp Meuser, DOM Publishers, 2024). My articles appear in the Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians, Architectural Histories, East/West: Journal of Ukrainian Studies, PLATFORM, and Bauwelt. I also co-direct two public history projects on housing insecurity and justice in American cities and towns during the current housing crisis. Currently, I am working on a comprehensive study of Ukrainian rural housing, as a cultural asset continuously and intentionally destroyed by the Russian army during the full-scale invasion.',
  p3: 'At the University of Utah, I teach graduate and undergraduate design studios, research methods, and architectural theory courses.',

  p1: 'My pedagogy is driven by my sense of our rapidly changing world and the architectural profession. The relationship between the students and the faculty, the composition of the student and faculty bodies, the substance of architectural education, and the ways of assessing its effectiveness are changing right in front of our eyes. To keep up with these changes, I use real sites, encourage and facilitate research, initiate community collaborations, and focus on the social dimension of architecture. These approaches allow students to construct empirical three-dimensional knowledge of the world they will be designing for.',
  p2: 'In my Fall 2023 and 2024 graduate studios, students developed experimental residential highrise projects for downtown Salt Lake City, Utah. The student designs reconsidered traditional ways of apartment living in a city currently undergoing a construction boom and rapid densification. To understand the scale of a housing unit in relation to Salt Lake urban morphology, we started the Fall 2023 semester with a two-week charette: students designed infill housing for the notoriously wide Salt Lake streets in partnership with a local affordable housing-focused developer GiV Group.',
  p3: 'In elective courses, I focus on global and local contemporary challenges from a joint humanities perspective: rather than looking at it solely through large-scale demographic or economic lenses, I focus on human experience in the built environment, because exposure to the experiences of others drives change and improvement and promotes care at a personal level. In my oral history and architectural documentation field course on Housing Insecurity in Mississippi, co-taught with Silvina Lopez Barrera, students interviewed community members and documented their lived spaces in order to write a public history of dramatic and continuous housing issues in this state.',
  p4: 'In my history and theory courses, I teach students to hold informed discussions and write. Architectural writing should go beyond the requirements of a basic writing and composition course; it must exhibit a kind of thinking only an architect can possess, using the strength of our specialized knowledge of the visual language of drawing, and of a relationship between an individual and the built environment. In 2023, under my mentorship as a writing advisor, Mississippi State University student Elisa Castaneda won the prestigious grand prize of the Aydelott Travel Award competition. Prior to Elisa’s victory under my mentorship, no student from Mississippi State University received the grand prize in this competition. Elisa’s accomplishment showcases her exceptional talent and persistence. It also reassures me that my dedication to the quality of student writing in classes I teach and projects I mentor makes a difference.',
